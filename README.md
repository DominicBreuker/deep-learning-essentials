# Deep Learning Essentials

Deep learning essentials is a collection of reusable code examples to get you started with deep learning.
The deep learning library of choice is Keras.
All the code works with both Theano and Tensorflow as backend.
Below is an overview of what you will find in this repository.
Each folder contains it's own readme with detailed instructions.
